Remove the enhanced embeds and emoji in WordPress 4.4 and above. All Emoji and oEmed features are removed by this plugin.

## Description ##

This plugin is a slight modification of Disable Embeds Plugin by Pascal Birchler. What this plugin does:

* Remove the oEmbed REST API endpoint.
* Turn off oEmbed auto discovery.
* Disables all JavaScript related to the feature.
* Remove oEmbed discovery links.
* Remove oEmbed-specific JavaScript from the front-end and back-end.
* Remove oEmbed-specific Plugin from Tiny-MCE WordPress Editor.
* Remove Emoji specific CSS and Javascripts.

Just activate the plugin and you are good to go. 

If you want embeds and emoji back again, simply deactivate the plugin.

## Installation ##

### Manual Installation ###

2. Activate Disable Embeds Emoji through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Is it really that easy? ###

Yes.

### What about previous embeds? ###

Since WordPress caches all embed codes, previous embeds from other sites will still work. However, your own website's embeds would not work at all when using this plugin. Emoji shortcode will not return funny emojis.

## Screenshots ##

There are no screenshots for this plugin.
